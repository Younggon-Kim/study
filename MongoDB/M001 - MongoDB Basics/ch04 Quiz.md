Before solving this exercise, make sure to undo some of the changes that we made to the zips collection earlier in the course by running the following command:
```
db.zips.updateMany({ "city": "HUDSON" }, { "$inc": { "pop": -10 } })
```
How many zips in the sample_training.zips dataset are neither over-populated nor under-populated?

## Quiz 1: $expr
### Problem: What are some of the uses for the $ sign in MQL?
Check all answers that apply:

- [ ] $ makes the world go round.
- [ ] $ changes the data type of the given value to a monetary denomination.
- [x] **$ signifies that you are looking at the value of that field rather than the field name.**
- [x] **$ denotes an operator.**

```
$ denotes an operator.
- This is correct.
- All MQL operators have the $ prefix.

$ signifies that you are looking at the value of that field rather than the field name.
- This is correct.
- When $ is used to prefix a field name, it represents the value stored in that field. This is very helpful for expressions that compare fields within the same document.

$ changes the data type of the given value to a monetary denomination.
- This is incorrect.
- While $ does have other awesome uses, changing the data type to some monetary denomination related is not one of them. There is no such data type in BSON.

$ makes the world go round.
- This is incorrect.
- Since this is a course that pertains to MongoDB only and not philosophy or history of pop-music (sorry Liza Minelli) this answer is not correct in the context of MQL and MongoDB in general.
