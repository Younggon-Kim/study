## Quiz 1: What is the MongoDB Database?
### Problem: Select the statements that together help build the most complete definition of the MongoDB database:
Check all answers that apply:
- [x] **The MongoDB database is an organized way to store and access data.**
- [ ] MongoDB database organizes documents in rows and columns.
- [ ] MongoDB's database uses tables of related data.
- [x] **MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses documents to store data in an organized way.**

```
MongoDB database is an organized way to store and access data.
- This is correct.
- This is a general definition of a database and applies to the MongoDB database as well as to other databases out there.

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses documents to store data in an organized way.
- This is correct.
- When we specify what kind of database MongoDB has, we can classify it as NoSQL because it does not employ related tables of data to store information, and it instead uses documents.

MongoDB database organizes documents in rows and columns
- This is incorrect.
- Documents are organized into collections.

MongoDB's database uses tables of related data.
- This is incorrect.
- Rows and columns are not part of the data organization in MongoDB.
```

## Quiz 2: What is a Document?
### Problem: In MongoDB how does a document relate to a collection?
Choose the best answer:
- [ ] Collections are documents that are organized in rows and columns.
- [ ] Documents are made up of collections.
- [ ] Collections consist of one or many documents.
- [x] **Collections are tables of documents and other collections.**

```
Collections consist of many documents.
- This is correct.
- A single collection in MongoDB consists of one or many documents.

Documents are made up of collections.
- This is incorrect.
- Documents are organized into collections, not the other way around.

Collections are documents that are organized in rows and columns.
- This is incorrect.
- Rows, columns and tables are not part of the data organization in MongoDB.

Collections are tables of documents and other collections.

## Quiz 3: What is a Document?
### Problem: In a MongoDB Document what is the role of fields and values?
Check all answers that apply:
- [ ] Values do not have to be attached to fields, and can be stand alone data points.
- [x] **A field is a unique identifier for a specific datapoint.**
- [x] **Each field has a value associated with it.**

```
A field is a unique identifier for a specific datapoint.
- This is correct.
- You can not have duplicate field names within the same level of a single document, which is why they are unique identifiers for a specific datapoint.

Each field has a value associated with it.
- This is correct.
- Data is organized in field-value pairs, so each field has a value associated with it.

Values do not have to be attached to fields, and can be stand alone data points.
- This is incorrect.
- Data is organized in field-value pairs, so each field has to have a value associated with it. A value without a field has no meaning, and no way to be stored.
```

## Quiz: What is Atlas?
### Problem: How is MongoDB Atlas related to MongoDB the Database?
Check all answers that apply:
- [ ] Atlas is a MongoDB service that can work with any database, but in this course it will be used with MongoDB.
- [x] **They both are MongoDB products.**
- [ ] MongoDB Database has the same functionality as Atlas, but without the friendly user interface.
- [x] **Atlas has many tools and services within it that are built specifically for the MongoDB Database.**
```
They are both MongoDB products.
- This is correct.

Atlas has many tools and services within it that are built specifically for the MongoDB Database.
- This is correct.

MongoDB Database has the same functionality as Atlas, but without the friendly user interface.
- This is incorrect.
- Atlas features go beyond the functionality of organizing and storing data, examples are Charts, Realm, Security features and more.

Atlas is a MongoDB service that can work with any database, but in this course it will be used with MongoDB.
