## Why MongoDB? (optional)
At this point you have learned enough to start having a meaningful conversation about why developers, DBAs, and companies choose MongoDB as their database.

This can also help you decide whether MongoDB is the right choice for you.

To help you learn more about specific use cases, we put together case studies and articles about some of our customers and community members.

We also added a link to the MongoDB Developer Hub and Community Forums where you can ask questions, learn new things, and connect with others who are diving into MongoDB content and products.

Take a look and feel free to browse for more information.
