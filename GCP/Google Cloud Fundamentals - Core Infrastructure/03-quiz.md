## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network
### 1. True or false? In Google Cloud VPCs, subnets have regional scope.
- [x] **True**
- [ ] False
```
That's correct.
VPC subnets can span the zones that make up a region. 
This is beneficial because your solutions can incorporate fault tolerance without complicating your network topology.
```
<br/><br/>

### 2. True or false: If you increase the size of a subnet in a custom VPC network, the IP addresses of virtual machines already on that subnet might be affected.
- [ ] True
- [x] **False**
```
That's correct. 
You can dynamically increase the size of a subnet in a custom network by expanding the range of IP addresses allocated to it. 
Doing that doesnâ€™t affect already configured VMs.
```
<br/><br/>


## Compute Engine
### 1. True or false: You can create Compute Engine virtual machines from the command line.
- [x] **True**
- [ ] False 
```
Correct! 
It's advantageous to create virtual machines from a command line when you want their configurations to be scripted and repeatable.
The gcloud command, provided by Google Cloud as part of the GCP SDK, can create virtual machines with parameters you specify.
```
<br/><br/>

### 2. What is the main reason customers choose Preemptible VMs?
- [x] **To reduce cost.**
- [ ] To improve performance.
```
That's correct!
The per-hour price of preemptible VMs incorporates a substantial discount.
